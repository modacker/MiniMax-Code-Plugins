# Capabilities

> Source of truth for what this webui can and cannot do. Every row has
> a status (✅ works · ⚠ partial · ❌ blocked), a why, and where to
> look in the code.

The webui is bound by three constraints:
1. What mcode 0.1.5 acp exposes via JSON-RPC.
2. What the Node `http` / `child_process` APIs can do.
3. What the browser's `EventSource` and `fetch` can do.

Anything outside these three is either ❌ blocked (no workaround) or
⚠ partial (workaround exists, with caveats).

CI asserts on every one of these names appearing in this document
(see `scripts/check-docs-alignment.mjs`); the table above is the
single index that satisfies the check.

## 1. Core chat

| Feature | Status | Why / where |
|---|---|---|
| Multi-turn conversation with streaming deltas | ✅ | `mcode-acp.js` reads newline-delimited JSON; `state-bus.pushEvent` broadcasts `delta` events |
| Multi-line assistant responses | ✅ | `parseChatLines` joins delta chunks per turn |
| Tool calls (Bash, Read, Write, Edit, …) | ✅ | forwarded from acp `tool_call` events |
| Auto-collapse of completed tool output | ✅ | CSS-only, no logic |
| Long chat list virtualization (≥ 200 messages) | ✅ | v2.0.0 lease C04: `public/app/chat-virtual-list.js` (216 lines, pure-logic helper) + `render.js` virtual-window branch (N ≥ 200) with scroll/resize rAF handler. `chat-virtual-list.test.js` (315 lines, 25 unit tests). |
| Markdown rendering (headings, lists, code) | ✅ | `lib/marked.min.js` vendored locally (no CDN) |
| Syntax highlighting in code blocks | ✅ | highlight.js (local copy) |
| Cancel mid-run | ⚠ | acp `session/cancel` returns "Method not found" in 0.1.5. The webui's `/api/protocol/cancel` falls back to SIGTERM on the subprocess. The acp session may emit a few extra events before dying. |
| Rewind / fork a message | ❌ | Not in mcode acp 0.1.5 |
| Edit a sent message and resend | ❌ | Not exposed by the acp protocol |
| Regenerate the last assistant response | ❌ | No acp method to discard a turn |
| Stream intermediate thinking (`<thinking>`) | ⚠ | Rendered if present in delta, but mcode 0.1.5 emits them as plain text — no structured separation |

## 2. Plan mode

| Feature | Status | Why / where |
|---|---|---|
| Enter plan mode (`/plan` slash) | ✅ | webui adds a `Plan: ` prefix to the prompt; mcode acp responds with a structured plan event |
| Plan review modal with options | ✅ | `renderPlan()` builds the modal; user choice goes through `/api/answer` |
| Plan with three or more options | ✅ | server returns `options` array; client renders N buttons |
| "Add context to revise" plan option | ✅ | `plan-add-context` textarea shown only when user picks option index 2 |
| Plan summary preview while still streaming | ⚠ | mcode acp emits `plan_summary` only on finalization. The webui shows the modal only after the plan event arrives. |
| Skip plan and go directly to execution | ✅ | option index 1 in the modal |

## 3. Permission prompts

| Feature | Status | Why / where |
|---|---|---|
| Session-level permission mode (`ask`/`auto`/`full`) | ✅ | `state.permissions`; webui sends `setMode` only via the `/api/protocol/set-mode` endpoint, which mcode 0.1.5 returns "Method not found" for. The mode shown is mcode's last-known value. |
| Per-tool permission prompt modal | ✅ | when acp emits a `permission` event, `checkModals()` opens `#perm-modal` |
| Approve / deny / always-allow-this-tool | ✅ | three options: `ask`, `auto`, `full`; sent via `/api/answer` |
| Pre-grant a tool for the rest of the session | ⚠ | same as mode setting; per-call only — there's no per-tool whitelist in mcode 0.1.5 |
| Custom rules (e.g. "Bash on /tmp is auto, rest is ask") | ❌ | mcode acp has no rule language |

## 4. Ask-user tool

| Feature | Status | Why / where |
|---|---|---|
| Modal question with 2-4 options | ✅ | `bindAskModal()` builds the modal from acp's `ask` event |
| Multi-select (checkboxes) | ✅ | acp `multiSelect: true` → webui renders checkboxes |
| Free-text "Other" input | ✅ | per-question "Other" field; sends via `/api/send {isAskAnswer:true}` |
| Skip / dismiss an ask | ✅ | the close button stores the question id in `DISMISSED_QUESTIONS` so it never re-appears in the same session |
| Re-show a dismissed question | ✅ | double-click the brand logo to clear `presentedKeys` |
| Re-prompt the same question | ⚠ | once a question id is in `DISMISSED_QUESTIONS`, the webui silently drops it. Clearing the set is a manual gesture. |
| Nested questions (one ask containing sub-questions) | ⚠ | the protocol supports a `questions` array; the webui renders them as separate modals queued one after another, not nested in a single modal. |
| Optional / required flag | ❌ | mcode 0.1.5 doesn't expose the optional flag — every question is treated as required |

## 5. Slash commands

| Feature | Status | Why / where |
|---|---|---|
| Built-in command list (`/help`, `/compact`, `/model`, …) | ✅ | mcode acp `session/commands` is fetched at connect; cached in `mcodeCommandsCache` |
| Command autocomplete on `/` | ✅ | `filterSlash()` builds the overlay; matches against `cmd` and `description_*` |
| Local (webui-side) commands | ✅ | `/exec` switches transport to mcode exec; `/clear` clears the chat UI without touching mcode |
| Hidden / experimental commands | ⚠ | the acp `commands` list returns everything mcode knows about. The webui has no `hidden` flag yet. |

## 6. Workspaces

| Feature | Status | Why / where |
|---|---|---|
| Switch workspace via picker | ✅ | `submitWorkspaceChange` POSTs to `/api/workspace` |
| Visual directory-tree browser (Windows drive roots) | ✅ | `/api/workspace/browse` lists children; `renderTreeNodes` builds the tree |
| Recent workspaces (last 5) | ✅ | `localStorage.webui_workspace_recents_v1` |
| Restore last workspace on reload | ✅ | `localStorage.webui_workspace_last_v1` → server `detect` then `change` on init |
| Lock workspace for the duration of a chat | ✅ | once a chat is started, the workspace chip is hidden; a new chat reopens the picker |
| Per-workspace git status (branch, dirty) | ⚠ | best-effort; the server shells out to `git status` once on workspace change. Errors are silently swallowed → the chip shows "—". |
| Symlink resolution in the directory browser | ❌ | `fs.readdir(..., {withFileTypes:true})` returns symlinks as `Dirent`; webui shows them as files. No symlink-follow option yet. |
| WSL path support | ❌ | `/api/workspace/browse` uses `path.join`, which on Windows is `\\`-aware but doesn't translate WSL `\\wsl$\…` paths |

## 7. Sessions

| Feature | Status | Why / where |
|---|---|---|
| Session list (sidebar) | ✅ | merged from `state.sessions` (webui JSON) + `state.mcodeSessions` (mcode sqlite) |
| Per-workspace session grouping | ✅ | `renderSessions()` groups by `workspace` field |
| Switch session on click | ✅ | `setActiveSession(id)` calls `/api/sessions/switch` |
| New chat from button | ✅ | opens the workspace picker first if no workspace is set |
| Delete session from sidebar | ✅ | two-tap confirm: `session-delete` button → 5-second confirm bar |
| Delete session in mcode sqlite too | ✅ | `/api/sessions/:id` DELETE handler calls `deleteMcodeSessionFromDb` (8 tables in a transaction) |
| Cleanup orphaned mcode sessions | ✅ | `/api/sessions/cleanup-orphans` lists mcode sessions not referenced by any webui session, then deletes them (scope: `orphans` or `all`) |
| Resume an mcode session opened in the TUI | ❌ | the acp session has a single owner; the webui shows a read-only banner when it detects a foreign owner |
| Cross-workspace session search | ✅ | the sidebar search input calls `GET /api/sessions/search` which aggregates matches across every workspace with a title (case-insensitive fuzzy match + per-workspace dedup). B03-gated. |
| Export a session to Markdown / JSON | ✅ | `GET /api/sessions/:id/export?format=md|json[&download=true]` (v2.0.0, lease C06) reads `.webui-sessions.json` (primary) + `runtime-state.sqlite` (best-effort secondary). B03 authorize-gated. `routes/export.js` (489 lines) + `routes-export.test.js`. |

## 8. Token usage & quota

| Feature | Status | Why / where |
|---|---|---|
| Per-turn context window (% used) | ✅ | webui accumulates `delta` events; per-turn value is computed in `renderContext` |
| Cache read ratio | ✅ | parsed from acp `cache_read_input_tokens` |
| tok/s (current stream speed) | ✅ | computed over a rolling 2-second window from `delta` events |
| `mavis` runtime db per-turn context (last turn) | ✅ | `mavis-usage.js` reads `local_runtime_token_usage`; per-turn calculation in `lastTurnContextTokens` |
| `mmx quota show` parsed | ✅ | `usage.js` wraps the CLI; refreshes every 2 minutes (silent) and on manual click |
| Time-until-reset (5-hour + weekly) | ✅ | `formatResetTime()` displays `n小时m分` / `n天m小时` |
| Forecast exhaustion time | ✅ | `GET /api/usage/forecast` returns linear + robust (huber) extrapolation from rolling 5h/weekly reset deltas (v2.0.0, lease C07). `server/lib/quota-forecast.js` (354 lines) + `lib-quota-forecast.test.js`. UI displays `formatForecastTime()` countdown. |

## 9. Attachments

| Feature | Status | Why / where |
|---|---|---|
| Click-to-upload button | ✅ | hidden `<input type=file>` opened by the attach button |
| Drag & drop into the chat area | ✅ | `chatArea.addEventListener('drop', …)` |
| Paste image from clipboard (Ctrl+V) | ✅ | `textarea.addEventListener('paste', …)` reads `clipboardData.files` |
| File path injection as `@file` | ✅ | `upload.js` saves to `MCODE_WEBUI_UPLOAD_DIR`; client injects `@/absolute/path` into the prompt |
| Image preview before send | ⚠ | filename only, no inline thumbnail. mcode acp accepts `@file` and decides rendering. |
| Multi-file attach (≥ 2 in one drop) | ✅ | `dataTransfer.files` iteration |
| Per-message attachment delete (×) | ✅ | `removeAttachment(idx)` |
| Resume upload after disconnect | ❌ | upload is sync (one-shot POST); no chunked upload support |

## 10. UI / UX

| Feature | Status | Why / where |
|---|---|---|
| Bilingual UI (zh-CN / en) | ✅ | `I18N.zh` / `I18N.en` tables; `t(key)` lookup |
| Light / dark theme | ✅ | `data-theme` on `<html>`; `prefers-color-scheme` initial value |
| Mobile responsive (< 900 px) | ✅ | CSS media queries; drawer layout for sidebar + right panel |
| Single column at < 600 px | ✅ | `flex-direction: column` |
| In-page debug log panel | ✅ | bottom-right black panel; copy / clear; 30-line ring buffer |
| Toast notifications | ✅ | `#toast-root` with 3-second auto-dismiss |
| Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+K focus, Esc close, …) | ✅ | global keydown handler in `attachEvents()` |
| Slash-command keyboard navigation (↑↓ Enter Tab) | ✅ | `slashInput.addEventListener('keydown', …)` |
| Dark mode respecting OS preference | ✅ | `prefers-color-scheme` media query at boot |
| Custom CSS themes | ❌ | no theme loader; would need a CSS-vars system |
| User-defined hotkeys | ❌ | shortcuts are hard-coded |

## 11. Network & access control

| Feature | Status | Why / where |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP server | ✅ | Node `http.createServer` |
| LAN sharing with on/off toggle | ✅ | runtime state in `settings.lanBroadcastEnabled`; closed by default for non-local IPs |
| Friendly 403 page when LAN is off | ✅ | `LAN_REJECT_HTML` template in `settings.js`; v1.0.1: single bilingual page (zh + en stacked), dynamic `PORT` (was hardcoded `7890` which broke at v0.5 default change) |
| Token auth (`?token=` or `Authorization: Bearer`) | ✅ | `server.js` validates `req.url` and `req.headers.authorization`; if set, every request must include the token |
| **Token auth: default-on (v1.0.1)** | ✅ | First start with no `TOKEN` env auto-generates a 32-hex token, persists to `~/.mcode-webui/settings.json` (mode 0600, atomic write via `.tmp` + rename). **v2.0.0 (lease C08)**: token no longer printed to stdout in 14-line ASCII box; instead a `token.first_run` SSE event is broadcast to all connected tabs and a single neutral `token persisted to: <path>` line is printed to stdout (gated by `MCODE_WEBUI_TOKEN_STDOUT=1`). The settings card shows the token until the operator clicks "我已保存 / I have saved it". `MCODE_WEBUI_SETTINGS_PATH` env overrides the file location. `TOKEN` env still wins (escape hatch). |
| **Token auth: reset + live broadcast (v1.0.1)** | ✅ | "重置 token" button generates a new 32-hex value, persists it, and broadcasts an `auth.token_rotated` SSE event with the new token. Each connected client updates its `localStorage` and the live `HEADERS.Authorization` object **in place** — subsequent `fetch()` calls use the new token automatically, no reload required. Crash-safe: disk write first, in-memory state committed only on success. |
| **Token auth: acknowledged state machine (v1.0.1)** | ✅ | After "我已保存", the server records `tokenAcknowledged=true` and stops including `currentToken` in subsequent `GET /api/settings` responses and SSE state pushes. UI replaces the value/mask row with a `✓ 已保存 — 查看请点"重置" / Saved — click "Reset" to view again` placeholder. Resetting triggers a new rotation. Persisted across restarts. |
| **Token auth: settings persistence (v1.0.1)** | ✅ | Token + readOnly + tokenEnabled + tokenAcknowledged + tokenRotatedAt + allowedInterfaces (no-op stub) all persist to `~/.mcode-webui/settings.json`. `lanBroadcast` remains in-memory only (intentional — reboot re-enables LAN so admins don't get locked out). |
| Read-only mode (v1.0.1) | ✅ | When on, non-local `POST` / `DELETE` to `/api/*` return `403 {"error": "read-only mode"}`. `GET` / `HEAD` / `OPTIONS` exempt. Local requests always exempt. `/api/settings` exempt (escape hatch). Persisted. Top-bar shows a red pulsing "只读 / READ ONLY" chip when on. |
| Per-cid SSE channel | ✅ | one EventSource per browser tab; one mcode subprocess per cid |
| HTTPS | ⚠ | v2.0.0 (lease C03) — HTTPS itself requires a reverse proxy; **fully documented** in `docs/HTTPS-REVERSE-PROXY.md` (387 lines, nginx / caddy / Traefik 2 configurations with SSE long-connection notes). No code change in webui. |
| mTLS / client cert | ❌ | same as above; documentation in `docs/HTTPS-REVERSE-PROXY.md` |
| Rate limiting | ✅ | v2.0.0 (lease C03): `server/lib/rate-limit.js` (252 lines) — token-bucket per-ip with 60/min default + 100 burst + 2× multiplier for token holders. Router gate 4 returns 429 when exceeded. `lib-rate-limit.test.js` (339 lines, 21 unit tests). |

## 12. Operations

| Feature | Status | Why / where |
|---|---|---|
| Zero npm install | ✅ | Node stdlib only |
| Configurable port via `PORT` env | ✅ | `config.js:34` |
| Configurable host via `HOST` env | ✅ | `config.js:36` |
| Configurable default model via `MCODE_MODEL` env | ✅ | `config.js:37` |
| Uncaught exception sink (`.server.err`) | ✅ | `installGlobalErrorHandlers` |
| Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM / SIGINT | ✅ | `mcode-acp.js` forwards signals to the child |
| systemd / Windows Service manifest | ❌ | out of scope; user is expected to use `pm2`, `nssm`, or run in a terminal |
| Hot reload of code | ❌ | restart the server |
| Health check endpoint | ✅ | `GET /api/health` returns `{ok:true, port, defaultModel, defaultWorkspace, mcodeCmd, mcodeVersion, maxConcurrent}` |
| Append-only event audit log (events.ndjson) | ✅ | v2.0.0 (lease B01): `server/lib/events.js` (494 lines) — NDJSON append with SHA-256 hash chain, monotonic `seq`, 200ms write-behind. 7 write-points patched: settings.js / sessions.js / upload.js / slash.js / db.js / export.js / alerts.js (dynamic). `lib-events.test.js` + `lib-events-hash.test.js`. `~/.mcode-webui/events.ndjson` (overridable via `MCODE_WEBUI_EVENTS_PATH`). |
| Independent anomaly SSE channel | ✅ | v2.0.0 (lease B02): `server/lib/alerts.js` (203 lines) + `GET /api/alerts` SSE + frontend bell icon + unread count. 3 levels (info/warn/error), 100-entry ring buffer, 60s dedup window. `lib-alerts.test.js` (17) + `routes-alerts.test.js` (7). |
| Per-request authorize gate | ✅ | v2.0.0 (lease B03): `server/lib/authorize.js` (354 lines) — `authorize(action, ctx, opts)` Promise with 5-minute default timeout (fail-closed), 8-action whitelist (`session.delete`, `sessions.cleanup-orphans`, `session.cleanup-all`, `session.export`, `session.search`, `token.reset`, `slash.clear`, `startup.cleanup`). 7 wrap-sites. `lib-authorize.test.js` (20 unit). |
| SBOM + CVE gates (local; no plugin-owned CI) | ✅ | Amended 2026-09-20 (webui-rigor-fix): the plugin-level `.github/workflows/ci.yml` was deleted — GitHub only reads workflows from the repo root, so it never triggered; the only CI is the marketplace root `validate` job (ubuntu / Node 22, `npm ci` → `npm run check`, see `docs/CI.md`). SBOM + CVE run as **local** gates: `scripts/gen-sbom.mjs` CycloneDX 1.5 + `sbom.cdx.json` (115 components) + `npm audit --omit=dev` + `.cve-ignore.json`; cross-Node/OS coverage is a manual matrix recipe in `docs/CI.md`. |
| `token.first_run` SSE event | ✅ | v2.0.0 (lease C08): `server/lib/state-bus.js#pushTokenFirstRun` broadcasts `{event: "token.first_run", data: {token, persistPath}}` to all `sseByCid` on first boot. Replay-guarded by `auth.js#isFirstRun()` + persistent `tokenAcknowledged` flag. |

## 13. What mcode would need to add to enable the ❌ rows

- `set_mode` / `set_config_option` → mid-session permission switch in the UI
- `cancel` → true mid-flight cancellation, not just SIGTERM
- `fork` / `resume` / `rewind` → rewind/regenerate UI
- `request_permission` with structured rules → per-tool whitelist
- `session/message.delete` → "edit and resend"
- `session/export` → export to MD/JSON
- `tool_call.input.thumbnail` → inline image preview
- A quota metric with rate-of-use → forecast exhaustion time
- An optional flag on ask questions → optional questions
- A path-prefix resolver for WSL symlinks → WSL path support

These are upstream asks. See [docs/acp-goal-plan-status.md](acp-goal-plan-status.md)
for the historical list and the response from the mcode team.
